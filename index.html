      // sorta the same thing as socket.send but you can send a custom event. see explanation here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11498508/socket-emit-vs-socket-send
      // basically with .send you could only call the function with .on("message"). where with socket.emit you can call the function with any arbitrary word like in this case "chat message". 
      // chat message is the "name" of the message kinda like the name written on a jar of jelly beans and anything after the "," are the jellybeans that are being transfered to the client. and in this case it is the value of what is in the input box in the form below
      socket.emit('chat message', $('#m').val());
      $('#m').val('');
      return false;

    socket.on('chat message', function(msg){
